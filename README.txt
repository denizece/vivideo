Libraries:
Beside android api, some other libraries such as javacv, javacpp, ffmpeg for android are used in the development of the app. 
Since these libraries are embeded in the app, Vivideo is an independent app and needs no external file or application to run. 
(There are some .so files under /lib/armeabi which are basically c++ code and other libraries are wrapper for these code to run on java)
 
Instructions for install:
1- To use the source code after importing the project in eclipse or android studio, running the application on an android device
